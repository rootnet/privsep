.Sh NAME
.Nm privsepd
.Nd The daemon for privilege separating php code.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Fl c Ar file
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl C Ar dir
.Op Fl g Ar group
.Op Fl s Ar socket
.Op Fl u Ar user
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an RPC daemon for PHP.
It is connection oriented and designed to provide an as near native interface
for the client as possible through the
.Xr remote 3php
interface.
Every connection is run in it's own process to ensure that multiple connections
don't interfere.
.Pp
Code made available through the daemon needs to be self-contained and is
loaded through the autoload directive in the configuration
.Ar file .
This autoload file is loaded at every connection, allowing code updates without
server reloads.
Besides regular calls
.Pq both functions and methods
the interface supports closures, arguments by reference, remote objects, and
cascading throwables.
Incoming function-, method- and attributerequests and returning throwables
originating are subject to a whitelist check before returning.
.Pp
If
.Nm
received a SIGHUP a graceful shutdown will be performed.
This means that active connections will be preserved, but no new connections are
accepted.
A new daemon can be started over the old listening socket after the signal has
been send.
This is useful for when the daemon needs a restart after a logrotate.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width xCxchroot
.It Fl C Ar chroot
Specifies the directory to which the daemon chroots.
This directory must contain all the dependencies for the code.
This includes the code itself.
.It Fl c Ar file
Specifies the configuration file.
There is no default file.
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize and log to
.Em stderr .
.It Fl g Ar group
The group the daemon will run as.
This can be either a groupname, or a gid.
.It Fl s
Specify the listening socket.
.It Fl u Ar user
The user the daemon will run as.
This can be either an username, or an uid.
.El
Although not required, it is strongly adviced to specify a
.Ar chroot ,
.Ar user ,
and
.Ar group .
.Sh FILES
The daemon does not provide default files, but the following components must be
provided either via cli flags or through the configuration
.Ar file :
.Bl -bullet
.It
Configuration
.Ar file
.It
An autoload file.
This file is used as the starting point for dynamically run code.
.It
.Ar socket
The location where the daemon should listen.
.El
